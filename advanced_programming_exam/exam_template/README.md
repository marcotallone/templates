## Project's organization

The project is organized with the following structure:

```bash
.
â”œâ”€â”€ apps # Ready-to-use scripts
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ main.cpp
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.py
â”œâ”€â”€ include # Include headers
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ header.hpp
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ setup.py # Setuptools installation
â”œâ”€â”€ install.sh # Quick compilation and installation
â””â”€â”€ src # Source files and pybindings
    â”œâ”€â”€ source.cpp
    â””â”€â”€ bindings_py.cpp
```

## Usage

To be able to use the implemented library in a `C++` script it's possible to import the `header_name.hpp` header file and link to the library at compilation time. Compilation details are explained below.

```cpp
#include "header_name.hpp"
```

For `Python` scripts the import of the `module_name` module it's necessary to use the implemented features. Further details on how to install the dedicated modules are explained below.

```python
import module_name
```

## Implemented Features

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required for the project to be compiled:

* [PyBind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - version 2.11.1 ([licence](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/blob/master/LICENSE))

## Compilation

Compilation of the implemented library is performed with the `cmake` system.\
By executing the following commands (and aventually specifying the correct `-DCCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` for eventual third party libraries if not found) all the `C++` libraries, as well as the python pybind11 modules, will be compiled in the `build/` folder.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/

make -C build/ -j<N>
```

To be able to import the implemented python modules, a `setup.py` script has been implemented to make installation easier.\
Installing the python module is possible by running the following commands from the root folder of the project:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace

pip install .
```

For a quick installation following this commands and `install.sh` script has been provided in the root folder.
