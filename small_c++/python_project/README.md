# Instructions

This is just a template for a small `C++/Python` project inspired from my final exam of the Advanced Programming Course held at UniTs, SISSA.

In order to use this template you should follow the instructions below:

* copy the `small_template` folder in this repository on your machine and change its name according.

* implement your header file(s) in the `include/` folder (name of the header can be changed)

* implement your source code and your pybindings in the `src/` folder (name of the files can be changed)

* implement your main or other scripts in the `apps/` folder
  
* to compile you should modify ONLY the `CMakeLIsts.txt` files in the `apps/` and `src/` folders. Parts that need to be changed have been highlighted in the relative scripts.

* To compile the pybindings with setuptools, change the names of the files and the name of the module where it has been highlighted in the `setup.py`

* follow compilations instructions (or use the `install.sh`) below in the pre-written README to compile.

To conclude also remember to update the README with the following:

* change the names of your files/headers/libraries/modules in the pre-written documentation (README)

* change your name and relative info

* change the exam date above and the year (if needed)

* complete the "Implemented Features" part with the description of what you did + add eventual dependencies

> * **DO NOT CHANGE** THE NAMES OF THE FOLDERS or THE POSITIONS OF THE FILES: that might lead to errors and it might require to rewrite the cmake...

> * This set-up has been tested and I've used it myself successfully, but I suggest you test it before the exam so you can get familiar using it. Right now this template only works for a cmake+pybinding set-up and it's only able to compile the C++ code into a shared library (small modifications are required for a static one). You're more than welcome to signal any problem by opening an issue in this repository.

Good Luck üçÄ
